# 🐦 Flappy Bird

A young me, fueled by creativity and love for gaming, decided to take on his fifth game development project — **"Flappy Bird"** in Python (Pygame).  
Call it efficient time management or my hate for pixel art at that time, but I decided to skip pixel art entirely for this game...  
Which, looking back, maybe I shouldn't have. But that’s what growth is for, right?

This version of Flappy Bird isn’t flashy — but it flies. And it carries with it the spirit of pushing through frustration, one flap at a time.

## 🎮 Insights

A 2013 mobile classic developed by a Vietnamese developer — *Flappy Bird* captivated the world with its simple, frustratingly addictive gameplay.  
A funny-looking bird. A series of pipes. And one question on every player’s mind:  
**"How far can I go?"**

It was chaotic. It was brilliant. It was everywhere.  
And this is **my take** on the legend — minus the pixel art, minus the music, but filled with the same stubborn determination to *just not hit a pipe*.

## 🎮 Controls

- **Flap Up / Jump:** ↑ Arrow Key  
- **Restart (after Game Over):** Enter/Return

## 📚 What I Learned

- Simulating gravity and physics through velocity control  
- Managing object-oriented design using `Sprite` classes  
- Creating timed obstacle spawning using ticks  
- Collision logic using `Rect` objects and hit detection  
- Keeping gameplay fluid without frame drops  
- Building restart logic without resetting the entire program

## 💬 Reflection

Flappy Bird was less about mechanics and more about **feel**.  
It taught me that a game can be simple but still *gripping*. That frustration and reward can be tightly interwoven through rhythm alone.  

It also taught me that skipping pixel art may save time… but it robs the game of some soul.  
I didn’t realize it then. But I do now.

Still, this version was mine — raw, clean, and flapping for dear life.
