# Flappy-Bird
A young me, fueled by creativity and love for gaming, decides to take on his third game development project i.e. "Flappy Bird" in python pygame. Call it efficient time management or my hate for pixel art at that time, but I decided to skip pixel art entirely for this game, which I shouldn't have when I look back at it.

A 2013, mobile classic developed by a vietnamese developer in which the player controls a rather funny shaped bird and flaps it up and down to avoid obstacles i.e. pipes. Its cartoonic art and music and the desire of the player to find out where it leads boosted the games success which encapsulated players into playing the game endlessly.

Here's my take on the classic, but mine doesn't have pixel art at all.
